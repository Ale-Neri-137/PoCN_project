# Complex Networks | projects

In this repository you will find the simulations and analyses carried out for the final exam of the *Physics of Complex Networks: Structure and Dynamics* course in the *Physics of Data* masterâ€™s programme (University of Padova, AY 2024/25).

The repo contains the code, processed data and report for two selected tasks:

- **Voter model (#28)**  
  Theoretical and numerical study of the classical voter model and the noisy voter model on various network topologies to explore ordering, consensus time and finite-size effects.  
  **Score:** 0.5

- **European transportation networks I (#45)**  
  Construction of rail European transport networks, pruned almost to a junction-level.  
  **Score:** 1.0
